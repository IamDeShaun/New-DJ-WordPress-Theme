# New-DJ-WordPress-Theme
DeShaunJones.com is a custom WordPress theme responsive website. The purpose of this site was to challenge myself to show my web development skills, and to develop a site to show my portfolio. I started off creating the wire frames using UXPin, then developed the static HTML pages using a bootstrap framework. 
From there I used underscores, and PHP to turn the static HTML pages into a fully customized WordPress theme.
